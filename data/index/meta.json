My main goal for this internship was to develop hands-on skills in the MERN area: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and be able to apply them within a real-world project context. This report presents the purpose of such an internship, work performed, used tools and software, and evaluation of the skills acquired in the context of my future career plans. First, one month was foundational to learn the basics of the MERN stack, and then two months were practical work on a project on GitHub. Company/Organization Description: Atos is the international leader in digital transformation, with its services ranging from cloud to cybersecurity, high-performance computing, and many others. The mission of the company is to help design the future of the information space, while the vision is to assist and be a leader in secure and decarbonized digital services. Operating literally all over the world, Atos has a formidable presence in Egypt through its Global Delivery Center in Cairo. It values client-centricity, agility, and sustainability, while the strategic objectives currently focus on digital security and hybrid cloud solutions. Atos' Cairo center is a base for services provided to clients from all over the world, utilizing Egypt's skilled manpower to provide digital workplace solutions, cloud infrastructure, application development, and SAP services. Internship Tasks Performed: During my internship with Atos, I was assigned a few tasks that contributed to a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. This involved the following: 1. Front-end Development: I did user interface development on React.js, putting great attention into making the components responsive and interactive. This included integrating dynamic forms and tables to make it more interactive for the user. 2. Back-end Development: Used Node.js along with Express.js for the development of RESTful APIs that handle data; MongoDB was used as a database to store application data. Designed CRUD operations to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete for user information. 3. Version Control & Collaboration: Version controlled using Git throughout the internship, and collaborated with team members on GitHub by making pull requests and resolving merge conflicts. 4. Deployment: I learned how to deploy web applications on the cloud, such as Vercel to host Frontend and Backend services. Working Conditions & Tools Used: The average workday involved liaison activities with senior developers and mentors in the planning and implementation of the features of the project. I used VS Code for coding, Postman for API testing, and MongoDB Atlas for database management. During this period, I got acquainted with working in Git and GitHub, and different debugging techniques in both React and Node.js. Internship Appraisal: It was quite an informative internship that gave insights into full-stack development using the MERN stack and helped to enhance my technical skills immensely. I have gained experience in modern development tools, including React.js for front-end development and Express.js for API creation on the back end. The expectation was matched by this internship because it gave me an opportunity to apply my knowledge academically to real-world scenarios and enhanced my understanding of web development immensely. It will make my career path more positive, confirming the aspirations of becoming a Full-Stack developer and integrating AI in my further work. The tasks I performed during this job closely correspond with the courses studied, including but not limited to algorithms, data structures, and BINF 405 Information and communication architecture 1 and 2. Finally, some teamwork and communication skills were developed while performing task coordination with colleagues on a regular basis. I would be glad to refer this company to my fellow students with its well-organized internship and probable employment opportunities to work on current technologies. Conclusion: Generally, this internship at Atos turned out to be quite educational and rewarding. I learned a great deal about the MERN stack and Full-Stack development besides learning important skills concerning version control, deployment, and teamwork. Atos operates in an extremely dynamic and innovative industry. It contributes a lot to the digital transformation of businesses all over the world. The internship has prepared me well for future challenges in the tech industry and was a good starting point for my career as a full-stack developer.
